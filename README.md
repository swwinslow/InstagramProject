Project allows the application-user to search for two Instagram Users of their choice by user name or full name.
After selecting/clicking a user from each side, the application-user may click the compare button to see a list of
Instagram-Users whom they both follow, as well as the number of Instagram-Users each individual follows.

Comparable Instagram Users displayed during the search process are public users only - logging in and incorporating private
users may be in the next iteration.

This project utilizes an open source JSON Library found at http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20150729 with the
condition to use it only for good.
